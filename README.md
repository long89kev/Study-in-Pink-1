# README

This repository contains code for an assignment implemented primarily in `study_in_pink_1.cpp`. The program is designed to perform certain tasks outlined in the `main.cpp` file.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp study_in_pink1.cpp -I . -std=c++11
```

3. After successful compilation, execute the program with the desired input file:

```bash
./main sa_tc_01_input
```

## Task Completion

Tasks within the `main.cpp` file can be individually checked for completion. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Uncomment the desired task in the `main.cpp` file.
2. Recompile the program using the same compilation command mentioned above.

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp study_in_pink1.cpp -I . -std=c++11
```

3. Execute the program as before with the updated `main.cpp`:

```bash
./main sa_tc_01_input
```

This process allows for the verification of each task's completion independently.

## Note

Please note that the primary implementation for this assignment resides in the `study_in_pink_1.cpp` file. Any modifications or enhancements should be made within this file.
